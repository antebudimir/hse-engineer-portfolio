            <h3>Future Growth Project
                <br>
                Wellhead Pressure Management Project</h3>
                
            <p> Kazakhstan is an enormously big country, biggest landlocked country in the world and 
                9th in size in total. Therefore, it's no wonder that they have all the elements from 
                the periodic table. Their energy reserves are very attractive and there are a lot of 
                foreign investments. Near Atyrau, a city in the western Kazakhstan steppe, there's a 
                huge reservoir named Tengiz Field, where the oil column reacHSE 1.6 km across. Tengiz 
                ranks as the world’s deepest producing supergiant oil field and the largest single-trap 
                producing reservoir in existence. The Future Growth Project-Wellhead Pressure
                Management Project (FGP-WPMP) will further increase total daily production 
                from the Tengiz reservoir. First oil is planned for 2022. Scope of work that Velesstroy received 
                includes site preparation, piling & foundations, manholes, steelwork, mechanical equipment integration, 
                pipework, anti-corrosion protection, insulation, electrical cables, telecommunication cables and
                temporary facilities required to support construction.</p>

            <p> Parallel with successfully completing works on the 3rd train on Yamal LNG project, Velesstroy was
                in the process of negotiating a new project that was starting to roll in Kazakhstan.
                It was to be the first project for Velesstroy outside of Russia. My boss Zeljko Posmodi,
                regional HSE Manager for the Yamal peninsula, participated in the negotiations presenting our
                HSE accomplishments on Yamal. After the first couple of rounds, I was invited to join the
                discussion with the potential client, Chevron. Soon after, Mr. Posmodi was offered to
                take over the HSE helm on this new project. He accepted and offered me a plane ticket if I would 
                like to go with him. Considering that we were a good team, I gladly accepted the offer. And if 
                anyone spent 2.5 years in the Arctic part of Siberia like I did, he will understand the need for 
                a change of scenery. <span class="smiley">&#128521;</span> </p>

            <p>Tengiz saw me rising in ranks and becoming HSE Compliance Lead. I was given freedom to choose 
                my own team so during the first couple of months I conducted a lot of job interviews and 
                hand-picked a team of 39 people. HSE officers, leads, site supervisors, data analysts, 
                IIF (Incident & Injury Free) coacHSE and HSE trainers were all a part of my team. In addition, I was 
                negotiating and proccuring PPE and other safety equipment with local suppliers and guiding Velesstroy's 
                subcontractors to ensure that they get to the same level of HSE standards that Velesstroy had to achieve 
                according to Chevron's CHSEM (Contractor Health, Environment and Safety) process. </p>

            <p>Besides that, I was writing procedures according to Chevron’s specifications and requirements and 
                participated in coaching sessions for emergency evacuation personnel because at the beginning of the 
                project I was one of only 2 persons on Tengiz with “Train the Trainer” certificate for “Avon Hood”, air 
                purifying escape respirator. </p>

            <p>All in all, 2 beautiful years on Tengiz. A lot of new things learned, a lot of experiences shared, 
                a lot of new acquaintances, a couple of close friends met… And the pinnacle of it all, at one dinner 
                in Atyrau I met my future wife Aliya. She is an interior designer. You can check out her
