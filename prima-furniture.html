            <h3>Prima Furniture</h3>
                
            <p> Prima was founded in 1995 in Bjelovar, Croatia. It is the biggest Croatian manufacturer
                of furniture with 8 factories and an extensive retail network, 57 stores in Croatia and 8 in 
                Macedonia. Today, Prima is also the biggest company in Bjelovar-Bilogora county and it employs more 
                than 2000 people. All furniture is made from Croatian raw materials and is exported throughout 
                Europe. Besides kitchen, bathroom, bedroom and living room furniture, Prima manufactures matressess 
                and pillows along with agricultural equipment.</p>

            <p> After I graduated from College for occupational health & safety in Zagreb at the beginning of 2010, I 
                was doing some occasional surveyor jobs with a friend from one construction company in Bjelovar for 
                the rest of the year. In December I’ve got a call from the employment bureau. They have a client 
                that is looking for an HSE Manager that would be stationed in my hometown Bjelovar but would be 
                covering all the company’s production facilities and chain stores across Croatia. Although happy 
                about the call, I 
                immediately said that I have no work experience in HSE especially on such a large scale. The 
                company employed 2000 people at the time and had 4 furniture factories, a mattress factory and
                a tractor and agricultural equipment factory. But the woman interrupted and said that it doesn’t
                matter. The previous manager quit suddenly for personal reasons and they needed someone ASAP to
                come and be present for the audit that was to be in 10 days. I went to a job interview and we 
                agreed on 1 month probation to see how things will work out and how will I fit in. The things 
                worked out good and I stayed in Prima for 1.5 years before embarking on a private venture with a 
                longtime friend.</p>

            <p> My responsibilities in Prima included providing health and safety training courses on necessary 
                safety procedures for employees, assisting external risk assessment organisations in conducting 
                periodical risk assessments, cooperating with regulatory bodies, drawing up safe operational 
                practices to minimize risk of workplace accidents, maintaining records of incidents and inspection 
                findings as well as preparing periodic safety statistics and submitting them to management for review. 
                Also, I organised periodical medical check-ups for high-risk occupations and advised on fire 
                regulations implementation and best practices in Prima warehouses and on waste management.</p>
