            <h3>Practical solution oriented HSE Engineer</h3>

            <img class="bio-image image-right" src="./img/playing.jpg" alt="Me playing synthesizer">
            
            <p>Some of the sentences from my childhood that still ring in my memory are: "Watch out for 
            this and watch out for that; don't walk there, it's dangerous; don't go near the edge, 
            you'll fall. At some point I got the impression that all that life comes down to is being 
            careful. And yet I have seen my parents so many times disregarding those same safety 
            instructions that they were giving to me like they are not endangered in the same way I 
            was.</p>

            <p>So what changes when we grow up? How come we start disregarding guidelines that 
            protected us during our first years of life? We're creatures of habits and when we repeat
            certain actions enough times that they become a second nature to us, (over)confidence kicks in.
            These are just some thoughts that I like to ponder about and discuss with my colleagues 
            and with people that attend my lectures.</p>

            <img class="bio-image image-left" src="./img/us.jpg" alt="Me and my wife Aliya">

            <p>Besides HSE, my interests revolve around web development, specifically HTML and CSS. 
            I have been working as a front-end web developer for a year now and I am seriously enjoying 
            making things work. Besides other things, this website was done by me. Also, I'm a huge 
            movie buff and a music connoisseur. I've played a guitar when I was a kid but today I'm 
            more focused on synthesizer. I produce nostalgic synth music reminiscent of 80â€™s synthpop 
            but with a modern twist based on pronounced bass lines and powerful kick drum that drives 
            the beat. You can check out my sound <a href="https://www.patternsofattachment.antebudimir.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> here. </a></p>

            <p> <!-- <img src="./img/us.jpg" class="img-left mobile-img"> --> Last but not least, I spend my spare time 
            with my wonderful wife Aliya traveling or just walking around the city in search of some nice 
            and comfy place to sit and enjoy. She is an interior designer, painter and she also does web designs 
            that I like to code into functional websites. You can check out her
            <a href="https://www.aliyabudimir.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">portfolio</a> if you are interested.</p>
